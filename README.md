# LaCroixFlavorProject

this was a project that was used for my father's job intervews. and i wanted to see if i could do it. now at first, i couldnt at that moment. i didnt even know about parseInt() or Number(). witch would have been essiential. this would have been pretty easy, but i wanted to do it in as little lines as possible. and it's not even technically complete but i have the main basis down. 

## what it do: 

it makes a leaderboard (kind of) 

## how it do

it takes strings, turns them into numbers, then puts those numbers into an array, and sorts said array in such a way that it makes a leaderboard. 

## how you do

npm install readline

node .

and that's it! (but of course, why would you do this lol)

## what i do

what i still have to do, cuz i didnt meet all of the requirements. 

A. make it loop the same function 3 times, (for 3 different tasters) 

B. make it add the results of the other 2 tasters into an array then sort that array

C. error handling (mainly if they dont add a number, or if one number is equal to another) 

D. get some gosh darn sleep because you're writing out this readme.md at 1:07 AM!
