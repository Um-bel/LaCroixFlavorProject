# LaCroixFlavorProject

this was a project that was used for my father's job intervews. and i wanted to see if i could do it. now at first, i couldnt at that moment. i didnt even know about parseInt() or Number(). witch would have been essiential. this would have been pretty easy, but i wanted to do it in as little lines as possible. and it's not even technically complete but i have the main basis down. 

## what it do: 

it makes a leaderboard (kind of) 

## how it do

it takes strings, turns them into numbers, then puts those numbers into an array, and sorts said array in such a way that it makes a leaderboard. 

## how you do

npm install readline
node .
and that's it! (but of course, why would you do this lol)
